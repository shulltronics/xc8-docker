PIC Development with XC8 and Docker
===================================

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration for a docker image that includes the tools needed to compile firmware for PIC microcontrollers using Microchip's XC8 compiler.

TODO: right now I log into the container and compile manually. Once I finish getting the toolchain, I should be able to just run the make command as a part of the `docker run` command.
